###[3] Name of Web Application: EasyCrypto

###[4] Intro: EasyCrypto is a web app to easily search crytocurrencies and their live data such as the market cap. It is created using React.js powered by CoinGecko's API.
The app is styled using CSS. I made and deployed this app although it's fairly simple because I don't think so my portfolio would be "complete" without having a project
that utilizes any API that serves cryptocurrency information. 

###[5] Technologies/Features Used:
* CoinGecko's API
* React.js
* React Hooks
* Axios (library to make HTTP requests)
* CSS
* CSS Flexbox
